On the first graph I made, I plotted two features in which all the mammals had, Milk and Breathes, which were two traits that the fish did not have. On the second graph, I used the variables legs and hair. The mammals have a range of 0-4 for the legs, but the fish all have zero. All of the mammals hace hair while the fish have none."
